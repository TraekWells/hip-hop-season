Hip-hop is a culture in itself that has its own set of terminology.

## Bar

Generally in music, a bar refers to a section of music that holds a certain number of beats. Each one of these sections can hold a number of beats ranging from three, four, six, or eight, although four is by far the most common.

In hip hop though, a bar is thought of as something slightly different. Taking the four count bar as an example, a bar would be the lyrics that a rapper said _within_ that four count.

In this audio clip, listen in the background when Royce counts. He's counting each time he finishes a bar right before the next one starts.

When you hear a phrase like "BARS!!", that can refer to either a single line or multiple lines that are particularly ðŸ”¥.
