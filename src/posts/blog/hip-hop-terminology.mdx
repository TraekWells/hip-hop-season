Hip-hop is a culture in itself that has its own set of terminology.

## Bar

A bar refers to a section of music that holds a certain number of beats. Each one of these sections can hold a number of beats ranging from three, four, six, or eight (these are the most common).

In hip-hop, a bar is the lyrics that a rapper says over a four-count of music.
