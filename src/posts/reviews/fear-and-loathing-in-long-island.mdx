I went into listening to this album having heard all of Ja'King's public releases. I knew that he was a super dope lyricist with a darkness to his writing which is right up my alley. Javi Darko was 100 new to me. After listening to _Fear and Loathing In Long Island_ a few times, I had to go back and find some of Javi's older work.
