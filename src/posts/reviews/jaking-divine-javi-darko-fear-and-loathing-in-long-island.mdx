title: Fear and Loathing In Long Island
artist: Ja'King The Divine and Javi Darko
bottomLine: This album is dark, abstract and the production sets the mood perfectly for what this album has to offer. Ja'King and Javi are a hell of a duo and I hope they continue to work together in the future.
finalThoughts: This project has everything an underground rap fan would hope for. Humor, darkness, lyrical density and most importantly, it doesn't drag on for over an hour. Ja'King The Divine is one of my new favorite artists and everything he releases is a must listen for me. Javi has gained a new fan in me as well.

The title of the album hits the mark of the feeling you get when listening to it.

I went into listening to this album having heard all of Ja'King's public releases. I knew that he was a super dope lyricist with a darkness to his writing which is right up my alley. Javi Darko was 100% new to me. After listening to _{frontmatter.title}_ a few times, I had to go back and find some of Javi's older work.

In a lot of ways, this duo between Ja'King and Javi reminds me of Eminem and Royce Da 5'9'. Their both excellent wordsmiths but their approach is different. Ja'King is the more lyrical and gritty of the two and Javi is the more abstract and humorous. They both have a darkness to their writing and they both have a very similar flow. I'm not sure if they are friends in real life, but they definitely have a chemistry that is undeniable.

The duo nailed it with the length of _{frontmatter.title}_. It clocks in at a little over a half and hour. With this kind of subject matter and lyrically dense writing, it's easy to get burnt out on a project that's too long. I think they did a great job of keeping it short and sweet.
