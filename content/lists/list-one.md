2019 was a hell of a year for hip hop project releases for both mainstream and non-mainstream artists. It started off with an absolute bang with Boogie’s Everythings for Sale (which I strongly believe is one of the top five albums of 2019) and continued into DaBaby’s Baby on Baby. By the end of the Summer, we also had what many people call the album of the year with Freddie Gibbs & Madlib’s Bandana and IGOR by Tyler, the Creator. Not to mention that Rapsody continued her mesmerizing display of song-making ability mixed with just raw bars on Eve while YBN Cordae hit the ground running with his debut album titled The Lost Boy.

There were definitely some artists that didn’t drop projects that I was hoping for and there were artists that did drop projects that I thought were underwhelming and am hoping for another in 2020. Here are five artists I need projects from in 2020.
