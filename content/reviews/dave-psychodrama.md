finalThoughts: This is the perfect album for someone new to Roc Marciano. He showcases his masterful ability to write seemingly perfect verses where every syllable is placed exactly where it should be while also keeping the album short enough to digest everything easily. It’s braggadocious, smooth and also aggressive but in an elegant way. This album might not be everyone’s taste because it’s somewhat repetitive and contains densely lyrical verses, but his core fans and hip hop heads come away with another gem to add to their rotation.
bottomLine: At this point, Roc Marciano’s gritty, dark rapping ability should be unquestioned and he delivers another gem to add to his already impressive catalog. His technical writing skills are right up there with the elites of hip hop.
