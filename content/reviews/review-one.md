title: Rip the Jacker
artist: Canibus
featured: true
finalThoughts: Rip The Jacker is Canibus in his most suitable setting. Rapping complex, scientific bars over sinister and ghostly beats that allow him to project his vision upon the listener. He’s always had the ability to rhyme words that almost appear to be made-up, but he finally found a way to combine that with superb production from Stoupe. This album is one of Canibus' best projects to date.
bottomLine: With a much-needed boost in production from Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind, Rip the Jacker showcases the lyrical mastermind that Canibus is and delivers some of his best work.

It would be next to impossible to name rappers on one hand who have the vocabulary that Canibus does. Hell, it would be difficult to name one, to be honest. This review is being written in 2020 and since the release of his debut album Can-I-Bus in 1998, Canibus has yet to fail to impress me lyrically over the years. With a seemingly never-ending supply of words to put together, he always finds a way to make me Google something new.

Canibus takes on one of his three alter egos on this album, Professor Emeritus Rip the Jacker. This is the super lyrical but also salty and bitter of the three alter egos. It’s like the smart kid in class who gets picked on for being brilliant and eventually goes on to be remembered throughout history for being great.

The opening track “Genabis” is a reference to the Old Testament’s first chapter Genesis. Over an eerie, church-like beat filled with bells and chimes, Canibus rap about how he became a fanatic about perfecting his rhymes. Fittingly, this came during the first seven days after the beginning of time.
