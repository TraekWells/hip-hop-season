title: Rip the Jacker
artist: Canibus
featured: true
finalThoughts: Rip The Jacker is Canibus in his most suitable setting. Rapping complex, scientific bars over sinister and ghostly beats that allow him to project his vision upon the listener. Heâ€™s always had the ability to rhyme words that almost appear to be made-up, but he finally found a way to combine that with superb production from Stoupe. This album is one of Canibus' best projects to date.
bottomLine: With a much-needed boost in production from Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind, Rip the Jacker showcases the lyrical mastermind that Canibus is and delivers some of his best work.
